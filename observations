# Observations of the cube

These strings are general observations for how the cube works

## 1

Any list of moves can be mirrored to return the cube to its native state.

    F
    D
    U'
    L'

Can become
    
    F
    D
    U'
    L'

    L
    U
    D'
    F'

## 2

Any rule that is mirrored in the way described in `# 2` can be considered as a context

A context is something where other moves can take place

    F
     D
      U
     D'
    F'

Where `U` is in the context of `FD`, and the `D'F'` pops back out of that context (like a stack)

This must not be confused with

    F
     D
      F'
       D'

The last two moves here do not pop out of the context, rather, they also build context

## 3

The moves

    L'
    L'

And
    
    L
    L

Are indistinguishable. Any two moves in consequtive order can be done in the same direction
(clockwise or anti-clockwise)

## 4

Any move or sets of moves that negate each other can be removed

This can be removed:

    L
    L'

Also this:

    D
    L

    L'
    D'

However, if mirrored groups of moves are used as context, then they cannot be removed without
changing a move's context

Here, `DL` and `L'D'` cannot be removed without changing the context of `U`

    D
     L
      U
     L'
    D'

## 5

You may swap opposing moves to have an opposite effect on the cube

Opposing moves are:

    F | B
    R | L
    U | B

For example

    F
     R
      R
       B
      R'
     R'
    F'

Can be swapped for

    B
     R
      R
       F
      R'
     R'
    B'

## 6

A move made within a context can be negated by re-entering the context

Like this:

    F
     U
      D
       R
      D'
     U'
    F'

    F
     U
      D
       R'
      D'
     U'
    F'


And brings the cube back to its original state

Since that brings the cube back to its original state, this set is now a context also, like

    F
     U
      D
       R
      D'
     U'
    F'
    
     D
    
    F
     U
      D
       R'
      D'
     U'
    F'

Due to observation `# 4`, this can now become, but you might also want to remove pairs before adding to the context

    F
     U
      D
       R
      D
       D
      D'
       R'
      D'
     U'
    F'

## 7

A context that is the cube's opposite side can be removed

    F
     D
      U
     D'
    F'
    F
     U'
    F'

Is the same as just:
    
    F
     U
    F'
    F
     U'
    F'

However, removing `L` and `L'` would change the context here:

    L
     D
      R
     D'
    L'


# A formal system with rules for dirivation

These are not how the cube works, but are rules for describing how to derive new theorems in the system
The aim of this system should be to find algorithms that change two or three squares, preferably

## 1

Any single value can be added to the inner-most area of the context

    F
     D
     D'
    F'

May become
    
    F
     D
      U
     D'
    F'

Later

    F
     D
      U
      U'
     D'
    F'

And again

    F
     D
      U
       F
      U'
     D'
    F'

## 2

Any contextual value can be removed, or switched, anywhere

This:
    
    F
     D
      U
     D'
    F'

Can become:

    D
     F
      U
     F'
    D'

By combining these rules outside the system, you can effectively add context of any kind
whereever you like. This makes it simple to step outside the system and create algorithms in an efficient way

## 3

Any set of well-formed contexts may be duplicated

This:
    
    F
     D
      U
     D'
    F'

Can become:

    F
     D
      U
     D'
    F'
    F
     D
      U
     D'
    F'

Due to observation `# 4`, this can now become

    F
     D
      U
      U
     D'
    F'
