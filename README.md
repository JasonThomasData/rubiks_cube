This is an attempt for me to learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube without following the online
tutorials. I've ran out of time so here is my work so far. There's likely a few algorithms missing
before I could complete the puzzle.

Download and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

You'll see:

    /maker
    /catalogue

They both are what they sound like

I attempted to make a formal system out of the cube, but it's not useful for finding algorithms.
However the `observations` file has some interesting insights about the cube.
