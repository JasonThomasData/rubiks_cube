This started as an attempt to solve Rubik's Cube by turing the transformations into a formal system. All useful findings that came out of that are in 'observations'.

I did, in the end, solve the Cube by using the algorithms that I found in the process of trying to create the format system. My approach is outlined in the 'solution' file.

This repo contains files that explain the nature of the cube. I've put them here so that they don't disappear, and they're in the 'article/' folder. I originally found them [here](http://www.orthogonal.com.au/gallery/scientific_american_articles.htm). The article is by the same person who wrote the wonderful (and daunting)20 book `Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Brain`. The article should give you enough details that will allow you to find algorithms to solve the Cube for yourself. 

Solving the cube with my own algorithms - although they are extremely inefficient - has been more rewarding than reading and learning someone else's algorithms. I think I have a deeper understanding because I took this approach.

### Use this software

Download and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

You'll see:

    /maker
    /catalogue

They both are what they sound like. They are made using TwistySim. If you want, delete the contents of `/catalogue` and do it yourself!

The `/maker` is useful for trying out algorithms, since it: 1) relies on entering algorithms to turn the faces, 2) can be reset if you make a mistake.
